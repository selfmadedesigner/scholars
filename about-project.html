        <h2>Conversations that empower; knowledge that endures</h2>
        <p>The <span class="text-highlight">Mellon Fellowship for High Impact Scholars, Artists, and Journalists</span> initiative aims to address the urgent need for support among scholars facing adversity. One of our objectives is to provide a digital repository that showcases the work of our fellows, a platform to share their research, art, and stories with the world.</p>
        <p>By leveraging digital tools and collaborative networks, we strive to amplify the voices of those who are often marginalized or silenced, ensuring that their contributions to knowledge and culture are recognized and celebrated.</p>
        <p>The <span class="text-highlight">High Impact Scholars Digital Repository (HISDR)</span> is a collaboration between The University of Texas at Austin and the UPR Caribe Digital Project, ascribed to the College of General Studies of the University of Puerto Rico Río Piedras Campus (UPR-RP).</p>
        <p>The repository showcases video, audio, transcripts, and images documenting <span class="italic-span">Cafecitos</span>, a series of conferences with students held at the UPR-RP with scholars, artists, journalists, and activists from Latin America and the Caribbean participating in the fellowship.</p>
        <p>These high impact scholars have faced political repression and censorship in their home countries. Therefore, it is crucial to document, store, and disseminate these valuable exchanges. Our mission to coordinate and preserve these conferences is based on a desire to expand the conversations about the scholars' work and experiences and disseminate their research and creative work.</p>
        <p>HISDR is a collection of voices that defy censorship, hardships and political repression, and bravely rise to inspire change. It is also conceived as a valuable learning tool that can be integrated in classes and scholarship. We promote conversations that empower and document knowledge that endures.</p>
